### Project Overview

 IPL Data Analysis with NumPy


### Learnings from the project

 - Slicing and Dicing 

- NumPy Operations like argsort(), count(), argmax() and many more 


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Started with reading the whole data and then slowly worked out with slicing to understand the data explicitly. After the slicing operations, implemented different numpy operations to analyze the IPL Dataset and answer  questions.
